## Steps to run the app

## What areas of the app did you focus on?

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?

## How long did you spend on this project?

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
- I built this using UITableView, but would have spent more time implementing this in a CollectionView as i feel it can provide greater flexibility as your featureset enhances.  For the sake of simplicity i made the trade off to create a UITableView instead.

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

## Did you copy any code or dependencies? Please make sure to attribute them here!
As a personal challenge, i tried to just put this together without any.  That said, a couple caveats.
- I did pull in a few extensions from code i've written in the past to simplify things.

## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?
- Unit tests are places next to their respective owner/class within the project hierarchy.
